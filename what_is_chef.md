# What is Chef?

Chef is an automation tool that provides a way to define infrastructure as code. Infrastructure as code (IAC) simply means that managing infrastructure by writing code (Automating infrastructure) rather than using manual processes. It can also be termed as programmable infrastructure. Chef uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configurations. Below are the types of automation done by Chef, irrespective of the size of infrastructure:

* Infrastructure configuration
* Application deployment 
* Configurations are managed across your network

Like Puppet which has a Master-Slave architecture even Chef has a Client-Server architecture. But Chef has an extra component called Workstation. I will talk about workstation in my next blog. Refer the diagram below:
